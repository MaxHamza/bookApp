The Rust Programming Language is the official book on Rust: an open source systems programming language that helps you write faster, more reliable software. Rust offers control over low-level details (such as memory usage) in combination with high-level ergonomics, eliminating the hassle traditionally associated with low-level languages. The authors of The Rust Programming Language, members of the Rust Core Team, share their knowledge and experience to show you how to take full advantage of Rust's features--from installation to creating robust and scalable programs. You'll begin with basics like creating functions, choosing data types, and binding variables and then move on to more advanced concepts, such as: Ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, and traits Using Rust's memory safety guarantees to build fast, safe programs Testing, error handling, and effective refactoring Generics, smart pointers, multithreading, trait objects, and advanced pattern matching Using Cargo, Rust's built-in package manager, to build, test, and document your code and manage dependencies How best to use Rust's advanced compiler with compiler-led programming techniques You'll find plenty of code examples throughout the book, as well as three chapters dedicated to building complete projects to test your learning: a number guessing game, a Rust implementation of a command line tool, and a multithreaded server. New to this edition: An extended section on Rust macros, an expanded chapter on modules, and appendixes on Rust development tools and editions.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781718500457"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1718500459"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":561,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.4.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qAOhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qAOhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qAOhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qAOhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qAOhDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":23.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":23.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qAOhDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qAOhDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":23990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":23990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qAOhDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"New to this edition: An extended section on Rust macros, an expanded chapter on modules, and appendixes on Rust development tools and editions."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"u13hVoYVZa8C","etag":"uD8fWKTS6Y0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/u13hVoYVZa8C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Planning Extreme Programming","authors":["Kent Beck","Martin Fowler"],"publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","publishedDate":"2001","description":"Without careful ongoing planning, the software development process can fall apart.

This new, fully revised edition of Al Sweigart’s bestselling Pythonic classic, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, covers all the basics of Python 3 while exploring its rich library of modules for performing specific tasks, like scraping data off the Web, filling out forms, renaming files, organizing folders, sending email responses, and merging, splitting, or encrypting PDFs. There’s also a brand-new chapter on input validation, tutorials on automating Gmail and Google Sheets, tips on automatically updating CSV files, and other recent feats of automations that improve your efficiency. Detailed, step-by-step instructions walk you through each program, allowing you to create useful tools as you build out your programming skills, and updated practice projects at the end of each chapter challenge you to improve those programs and use your newfound skills to automate similar tasks. Boring tasks no longer have to take to get through—and neither does learning Python!","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781593279936"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1593279930"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":593,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RQ6xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RQ6xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RQ6xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RQ6xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RQ6xDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":23.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":23.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RQ6xDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RQ6xDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":23990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":23990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RQ6xDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The second edition of this international fan favorite includes a brand-new chapter on input validation, Gmail and Google Sheets automations, tips for updating CSV files, and more."}}]
